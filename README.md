# Irrigation Data Visualization and Analysis Tool
### Kirin Mackey

## Description
In this project, I am going to make a tool in Dash where a user can visualize and analyze irrigation data from the United States Departmentment of Agriculture (USDA). 



## Quick Start Guide
To explore my current code, first create a `data` folder, containing both files held in the `data` folder in this repository. They hold irrigation data collected by the USDA, and state abbreviation data used by the CDC. More information about them can be read about in the data description section of my project proposal found. You'll then also want to create a `src` folder containing the [irrigation_db.py](src/irrigation_db.py) file found in the `src` folder in this repository. This file builds a database, cleans the data from the USDA and CDC, and inserts the cleaned data into the database's relational tables. Lastly, download the [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) notebook to look at my functions with some documentation, as well as some examples (one of which directly references my writeup) to run through.
